Hand movement classification from EMG signals across different subjects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To reproduce all results, this notebook should be run with the correct **Python version** inside the specified **virtual environment** to use all packages with the correct version.

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management and versioning. This project was developed for Python `3.10.13` and Poetry `1.7.1`. We recommend installing Python via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and Poetry via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/).

```bash
pyenv install 3.10.13
```

Then, install Poetry via `pipx` (if not installed yet):

```bash
pipx install poetry==1.7.1
```

The project has a `.python-version` in the root directory, which will automatically activate the correct Python version when you enter the project directory. You can check that the correct Python version is used by running `python --version` and similarly for poetry running `poetry --version`.

Next, you can install all dependencies via Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Finally, run the following to add the virtual environment to Jupyter:

```bash
poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name=emg-signal-movement-clf
```

## üîó Reproduce

To reproduce all results, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run main.py
```
